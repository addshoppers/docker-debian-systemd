# Docker image build script.
#
# This script should help to create the systemd enabled Debian images. It builds
# a new image for a specific tag (the current stable release by default) and
# pushes the new image to Docker hub. Later, all images may be bundled as multi
# arch image with the manifest script.
#
# NOTE: At the time of writing this script, the Docker daemon needs experimental
#       features enabled to gain support of squash image building.

# Get the OS type. As Debian runs at Linux only, the OS type should match linux
# or an error message will be printed and the script exits.
